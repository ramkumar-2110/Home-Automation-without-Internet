# Home-Automation-without-Internet
In this project we use esp wroom 32 to process the inputs given to that ,
ex:device 1 - ON it makes the device 1's GPIO pin high and that pin drives the transistor 
transistor is connected to relay , if the transistor is on then relay is switched ON 
by this implementation we made the home appliances ON by the given input
The main thing is no need for internet and many devices can be connected to the esp by esp acting as the "Access Point" mode
If we once connect to esp by its hotspot its automatically through the web page to ON and OFF the appliances
